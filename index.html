            <h4>Frequently Asked Questions</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Do I need to attend Anime Weekend Atlanta in order to participate?</b><br/><br/>
                    Yes! Every editor must attend the convention and edit their video in the Thunderdome at AWA.<br/>&nbsp;
                </li>

                <!--<li><b>When my team 'contributes one song', of course that's the song we'll use, right?</b><br/><br/>
                    Probably not! If six teams contribute songs, the VAT will also contribute six songs. Each team
                    then gets an opportunity to veto a song and remove it from the competition. They might veto one
                    of the songs we added, they might veto the song your team added... but even if your song survives
                    the cull, songs are selected in the order teams enter The Video Art Thunderdome... and another team
                    may edit before you and choose your song!<br/> </li>-->

                <li><b>What if there's something reall cool going on during my editing time, may I change?</b><br/><br/>
                    Sign ups for editing time in The Video Art Thunderdome won't begin until the official convention
                    schedule
                    has been released online. We ask you check it before signing up! We ask you do not miss your editing
                    time because we expect the pre-arranged slots to be full. Makeup time will be available, however it
                    will
                    be in the small hours of the morning when everyone will be sleeping. Please don't miss your
                    scheduled
                    time.<br/>&nbsp;</li>

                <li><b>What if one of my teammates can't attend or is otherwise unable to edit?</b><br/><br/>
                    Teams are not final until all team members have selected an editing time, if scheduling is still
                    open,
                    you are welcome to bring in a substitute editor. However, once scheduling is closed, your team is a
                    team
                    and you succeed or fail together as a team. If one of your editors misses their slot and cannot make
                    up their editing time, the rest of your team must continue without them! No, one of your other
                    members
                    cannot edit during their fallen comrade's scheduled time! Each editor gets an hour and that is all,
                    and the last editor gets an extra hour to turn the result into a final video.<br/>&nbsp;</li>

                <li><b>What software will we be using to edit?</b><br/><br/>
                    The system will be equipped with <!--Sony Vegas, -->Adobe Premere and Adobe After Effects. In addition VLC
                    will
                    be available for testing and <!--Zarx GUI --> Handbrake will be available for re-encoding.<br/>&nbsp;</li>

                <li><b>Can we get a copy of our final timeline?</b><br/><br/>
                    Sure, bring your own USB drive.<br/>&nbsp;</li>
